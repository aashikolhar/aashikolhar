- 👋 Hi, I’m Aashish Kolhar
- I am basically a Mechanical Engineer 🧑‍🔧 with a specialization in Thermal Engineering.
- Currently working in Hyundai Motor India Ltd as a Manufacturing Specialist in Paint Shop.
- 👀 Recently I have developed immense interest in Machine Learning and Deep Learning subjects which has even compelled me to open an account on GitHub.
- I am a self-learnt ML/DL/Data Science Engineer with a Mechanical Background.
- I believe that if you are an Engineer and are well versed in the field of Mathematics, you can learn ML/DL, for that you don't necessarily have to be a hardcore Software Engineer, but ofcourse need to have lot of programming skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Tensorflow for building Deep Learning models.
